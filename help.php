<!--<hr />--><h2 class="hidingborder">What is RANKPION and how does it work? </h1>
<br/>RANKPION is a community that allows you to SHARE and RATE pics with the users from your city and ranks the users depending on their SCORES.  
<br/><br/>RANKPION allows you to show the things you are interested in; you feel proud about; you enjoy… to other USERS within YOUR CITY. 
<br/><br/>Depending on your activity, you will get points that will rank you against people within your city in various categories. 
<br/><br/><br/>


<!--<hr />--><h2 class="hidingborder">What shall I do? </h1>
<h2>1.- Get registered</h2> www.rankpion.com 
<h2>2.- Upload some pictures </h2> within the categories you are interested in 
<h2>3.- Rate Picts of Users from your Town / City</h2> You rate and are rated by the users from your own community!
<h2>4.- Get your Rankpion score in your Area </h2> OVERALL, Daily, Weekly scores... You have always plenty of chances to be seen by the people from your community in the top 3!
<br/><br/><br/>

<!--<hr />--><h2 class="hidingborder">How do I get the points:</h1>
<br/>It all depends on your activity. Basically, you will get points with any action, but some give you more points. 
<br/><br/>With these points, you get your score that ranks you within a category (or the overall one) in your area. The three best users are the RANKPIONS of your area and will appear in the RANKPION’s PODIUM for all the categories! 
<br/><br/>* You can also see your full areas or any other areas rankings.  
<br/><br/><br/>

<!--<hr />--><h2 class="hidingborder">What actions provide me with more points: </h1>
<br/>By number of points given:
<br/>
<br/> - Submitting pictures (more pics means more points)
<br/> - Rating any pictures: (the more pics you rate, the more points you get)
<br/> - The scores you get in your pictures: (the better your average is, the more points you get)
<br/> - The amount of people you are FAV of.
<br/> - The comments you made and other users made on your pics
<br/> - ...
<br/><br/>With these points, you get your score that ranks you within a category (or the OVERALL one) in your area. 
<br/><br/>The three best users are the RANKPIONS of your area and will appear in the RANKPION’s PODIUM!
<br/><br/><br/>

<!--<hr />--><h2 class="hidingborder">Can I appear in the RANKPION PODIUM? </h1>
<br/>YES, anyone can do it, it only depends on your activity! The RANKING is updated daily, weekly and monthly so stay active during that period and you will be there soon!
<br/><br/>TIP: increase your activity within the categories you are interested in, to escalate and reach a RANKPION position in the PODIUM
